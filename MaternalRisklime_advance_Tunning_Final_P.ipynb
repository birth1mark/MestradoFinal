The objective of this study is to explore the dataset, preprocess the data by handling outliers and engineering relevant features, and build and evaluate different machine learning models to predict maternal health risk levels. The goal is to identify key variables associated with maternal health risk and determine which models perform best for this classification task.\n","\n","## 2. Data Loading and Understanding\n","\n","The dataset was fetched from the UCI repository using the `ucimlrepo` library. It contains features related to maternal health and a target variable indicating the risk level.\n","\n","Initial exploration of the dataset using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` revealed the structure of the data, the data types of the features (mostly integers and floats), and basic statistical summaries. The dataset contains 1014 instances and 6 features: Age, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP, BS (Blood Sugar), BodyTemp, and HeartRate, with 'RiskLevel' as the target variable. There were no missing values identified in the dataset during this initial inspection."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5a12503f"},"source":["## 3. Data Preprocessing\n","\n","Data preprocessing was a crucial step to prepare the dataset for model training. This involved the following stages:\n","\n","### 3.1. Handling Missing Values\n","\n","A check for missing values was performed on both the feature set (`X`) and the target variable (`y`). Fortunately, no missing values were found in this dataset, eliminating the need for imputation or removal of data points due to missingness.\n","\n","### 3.2. Identifying and Handling Outliers\n","\n","Outliers in the numerical features were identified through visualization using box plots. To address the potential impact of outliers on model performance, the Interquartile Range (IQR) method was applied to programmatically detect outliers. Values falling below the lower bound (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR) or above the upper bound (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR) were capped at these respective bounds. This capping strategy was applied to the numerical features in a copy of the original feature DataFrame (`X_cleaned`).\n","\n","### 3.3. Feature Engineering\n","\n","New features were created or existing ones transformed to potentially enhance the predictive capability of the models:\n","\n","*   **BP\\_Interaction:** A new feature was engineered by multiplying the 'SystolicBP' and 'DiastolicBP' features. This interaction term was created to capture the combined effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on maternal health risk.\n","*   **BS\\_log:** A log transformation was applied to the 'BS' (Blood Sugar) feature. Although the initial descriptive statistics did not show extreme skewness, a log transformation can sometimes help in normalizing the distribution of a variable and improve model performance, especially with skewed data. A small constant was added to the 'BS' values before applying the logarithm to avoid issues with zero values.\n","*   **Target Variable Encoding:** The categorical target variable 'RiskLevel' was encoded into numerical format using `LabelEncoder`. This was necessary because most machine learning algorithms require numerical input for the target variable. The unique risk levels ('low risk', 'mid risk', 'high risk') were mapped to numerical labels."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7557ec92"},"source":["## 4.

The Random Forest model achieved a slightly higher accuracy on the test set in this analysis. The engineered features, particularly the interaction term and log-transformed blood sugar, along with selected original features, proved valuable in improving the predictive performance of the models.

A interpretabilidade local, como a fornecida pelo LIME, é crucial para entender por que um modelo fez uma previsão particular para um ponto de dados individual, em contraste com a interpretabilidade global, que se concentra no comportamento geral do modelo.\n","\n","Para cada modelo, o gráfico LIME para a instância selecionada ilustra a contribuição de cada característica de entrada para a previsão final do modelo para essa instância.\n","\n","Barras Laranja: Representam características que fornecem evidência a favor da classe predita pelo modelo para a instância em questão.

Quanto maior a barra azul, mais fortemente essa característica se opôs à previsão daquela classe.\n","Os valores numéricos exibidos abaixo dos nomes das características correspondem aos valores reais (não escalonados) das características para a instância específica que está sendo explicada. Isso permite correlacionar o valor da característica com sua influência na previsão.\n","\n","Interpretação no Contexto da Predição de Risco de Saúde Materna:\n","\n","Ao examinar os três gráficos LIME, você pode observar como cada modelo utilizou as características ('Age', 'BS', 'BS_log', 'BP_Interaction', 'DiastolicBP') para chegar à sua previsão de nível de risco (baixo, médio ou alto) para a instância explicada.\n","\n","Por exemplo, se a instância explicada foi prevista como \"baixo risco\" pela Random Forest, o gráfico LIME para a Random Forest mostrará quais características (e seus valores) contribuíram mais para essa previsão de baixo risco (barras laranja) e quais características tentaram \"empurrar\" a previsão para um risco maior (barras azuis). Você pode notar que características como 'Age' ou 'BS' com valores dentro de certas faixas podem ter uma forte influência na previsão de risco, mas a direção e a magnitude dessa influência podem variar entre os modelos.\n","\n","Comparação entre Modelos:\n","\n","As diferenças nos gráficos LIME entre a Regressão Logística, Random Forest e XGBoost destacam as distinções subjacentes em como esses algoritmos modelam a relação entre as características e a variável alvo.

Cruzada).\n","\n","    Espaço de Busca: Definimos um espaço de busca (param_distributions) contendo distribuições de valores plausíveis para cada um dos hiperparâmetros selecionados (conforme mostrado na célula com param_distributions).\n","    Estratégia de Busca: Empregamos o RandomizedSearchCV da biblioteca scikit-learn. Esta abordagem amostra aleatoriamente um número fixo (n_iter=100 na primeira tentativa, e os resultados da segunda tentativa com o melhor modelo foram 0.8621) de combinações de hiperparâmetros do espaço de busca definido. Isso é mais eficiente computacionalmente do que o Grid Search completo quando o espaço de busca é grande.\n","    Validação Cruzada: A avaliação de cada combinação de hiperparâmetros amostrada foi realizada utilizando cross-validation (5 folds). Isso garante que a avaliação do desempenho seja mais robusta e menos dependente de uma única divisão entre treino e validação.\n","    Execução: O RandomizedSearchCV foi ajustado aos dados de treinamento (X_train, y_train). Durante este processo, o algoritmo treinou e avaliou modelos XGBoost para cada combinação amostrada usando validação cruzada e manteve o conjunto de hiperparâmetros que resultou na melhor acurácia média nos folds de validação.\n","    Melhores Parâmetros: Os melhores hiperparâmetros encontrados pelo Randomized Search para o XGBoost foram: {'subsample': 0.7, 'reg_lambda': 0.1, 'reg_alpha': 0.001, 'n_estimators': 100, 'max_depth': 7, 'learning_rate': 0.3, 'gamma': 0, 'colsample_bytree': 0.8} (conforme a saída da célula 320b1e10).\n","\n","Impacto nos Resultados do XGBoost:\n","\n","    Modelo Padrão (sem ajuste): A acurácia no conjunto de teste foi de aproximadamente 85.71% (conforme a saída da célula ec69b0fa).\n","    Modelo Ajustado (com melhores parâmetros encontrados): A acurácia no conjunto de teste foi de aproximadamente 86.21% (conforme a saída da célula 4de13d4c).\n","\n","O ajuste de hiperparâmetros resultou em uma pequena melhoria na acurácia geral do modelo XGBoost no conjunto de teste (+0.5%). Embora a melhoria na acurácia geral tenha sido modesta neste caso, é fundamental analisar o relatório de classificação (célula 4de13d4c) para entender o impacto nas métricas por classe (precisão, recall, f1-score), pois o ajuste pode ter melhorado o desempenho para classes específicas, o que é crucial em problemas de classificação desbalanceados ou onde a identificação correta de uma classe (como \"alto risco\") é mais importante.\n","\n","Hiperparâmetros e Otimização para Random Forest:\n","\n","O Random Forest é um algoritmo de ensemble baseado em árvores que constrói múltiplas árvores de decisão e combina suas previsões. Alguns hiperparâmetros importantes incluem:\n","\n","    n_estimators: O número de árvores na floresta. Um número maior geralmente melhora a robustez e o desempenho, mas aumenta o custo computacional.\n","    max_depth: A profundidade máxima de cada árvore. Controla a complexidade individual das árvores. None significa que as árvores expandem até que todos os nós sejam folhas ou contenham menos que min_samples_split amostras.\n","    min_samples_split: O número mínimo de amostras necessárias para dividir um nó interno. Controla o crescimento das árvores e a complexidade do modelo.\n","    min_samples_leaf: O número mínimo de amostras necessárias para estar em um nó folha. Semelhante a min_samples_split, controla o crescimento e a complexidade.\n","    max_features: O número de características a considerar ao procurar a melhor divisão. sqrt (raiz quadrada do número total de features) ou log2 são opções comuns. Ajuda a decorrelacionar as árvores na floresta.\n","    bootstrap: Se as amostras são retiradas com substituição ao construir cada árvore. True é o padrão e ajuda a criar árvores mais diversas.\n","\n","Otimização dos Hiperparâmetros do Random Forest:\n","\n","Também utilizamos Randomized Search com Cross-Validation para o Random Forest:\n","\n","    Espaço de Busca: Definimos um espaço de busca (param_distributions_rf) para os hiperparâmetros relevantes do Random Forest (conforme mostrado na célula 8e56a75b).\n","    Estratégia de Busca e Validação Cruzada: Similar ao XGBoost, utilizamos RandomizedSearchCV com 5-fold cross-validation. Na primeira tentativa, usamos 100 iterações, e na segunda tentativa, aumentamos para 200 iterações (conforme a célula a3c817a0) para explorar mais combinações.\n","    Execução: O RandomizedSearchCV foi ajustado aos dados de treinamento.\n","    Melhores Parâmetros: Os melhores hiperparâmetros encontrados pelo Randomized Search para o Random Forest com 200 iterações foram: {'n_estimators': 500, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'max_features': None, 'max_depth': 40, 'bootstrap': True} (conforme a saída da célula 0087f37d).\n","\n","Impacto nos Resultados do Random Forest:\n","\n","    Modelo Padrão (sem ajuste): A acurácia no conjunto de teste foi de aproximadamente 87.19% (conforme a saída da célula 0c5cd256).\n","    Modelo Ajustado (com melhores parâmetros encontrados após 200 iterações): A acurácia no conjunto de teste foi de aproximadamente 85.71% (conforme a saída da célula cd8093fc). Nota: Houve um pequeno decréscimo na acurácia geral neste último ajuste, o que pode ocorrer devido à natureza aleatória do Randomized Search e da divisão dos dados, ou porque o espaço de busca e o número de iterações ainda não foram suficientes para encontrar a combinação ideal que generalize melhor.\n","\n","Considerações Acadêmicas:\n","\n","    Variação nos Resultados: É importante notar que os resultados do Randomized Search podem variar ligeiramente entre as execuções devido à natureza aleatória da amostragem. Para obter resultados mais robustos, pode-se aumentar o número de iterações ou executar a busca múltiplas vezes.\n","    Espaço de Busca: A performance da otimização depende criticamente do espaço de busca definido. Um espaço muito restrito pode não conter a combinação ideal, enquanto um espaço muito amplo pode exigir um número proibitivo de iterações (especialmente para Grid Search). A definição do espaço de busca geralmente requer algum conhecimento prévio dos hiperparâmetros e experimentação inicial.\n","    Métrica de Avaliação: A métrica utilizada para scoring no RandomizedSearchCV (neste caso, 'accuracy') influencia quais parâmetros são considerados \"melhores\". Em problemas com desequilíbrio de classes, pode ser mais apropriado usar métricas como F1-score, Precision, Recall ou AUC.\n","    Overfitting na Otimização: Embora a validação cruzada ajude, ainda há um risco de overfitting dos hiperparâmetros ao conjunto de validação. A avaliação final em um conjunto de teste completamente separado (como fizemos) é crucial para uma estimativa imparcial do desempenho do modelo ajustado.\n","    Comparação Final: Com base nos testes realizados, o modelo Random Forest com parâmetros padrão ou o XGBoost ajustado apresentaram as maiores acurácias gerais neste conjunto de teste.
